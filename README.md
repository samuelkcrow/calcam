This is a tool that downloads a jpeg from a URL at periodic intervals (such as every 3 minutes). It can also stitch these images together into a .gif animation.
I created this in the winter of 2018 to pull images from a public webcam at Calvin University. After intitial development and debugging, I was able to leave it running continuously on a virtual server for 6 months. I stopped using it because I got tired of paying for the virtual server, but I am happy to say it did exactly what I wanted (create timelapses of outdoor conditions, especially snowfall/snowmelt).
Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about this project.
